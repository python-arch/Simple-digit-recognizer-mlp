# Simple-digit-recognizer-mlp
Designing a simple 2 layer (associator unit) and (output unit) neural network which takes 28 by 28 pixels handwritten digit photo and predict the  label
The idea behind this neural network is that it is built from scratch using only numpy , linear algebra and other. The used learning algorithm was gradient descent and it was implemented from scratch.

The reached accuracy after adjusing the needed paramters and training the model:
